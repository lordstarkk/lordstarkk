## Orientation

**I build systems to reduce friction, increase control, and compound over time.**

I focus on building reliable systems — software that works quietly,
scales logically, and improves through discipline.

---

## Current Direction

- Backend engineering with emphasis on APIs, data flow, and system boundaries  
- **Web development** with focus on backend-driven applications and system design  
- Linux-first workflows and tooling discipline  
- Strengthening core programming and computer science fundamentals  
- Developing **NYRON** — a long-term personal AI & automation system
